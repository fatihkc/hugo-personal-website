I build resilient, secure, and cost‑effective cloud platforms on AWS, Azure, and GCP using Kubernetes, Terraform, and modern CI/CD. I enjoy solving reliability problems, automating everything that can be automated, and turning operational pain into platform products teams love to use.

## What I do

- Design and operate production‑grade Kubernetes with a focus on security, scalability, and cost efficiency
- Implement Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and GitOps workflows with Argo CD and Helm
- Build CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) that are fast, reliable, and observable end‑to‑end
- Introduce monitoring, tracing, and logging best practices with Prometheus/Grafana and cloud‑native tooling
- Optimize AWS spend through right‑sizing, autoscaling, and architectural improvements

## Core skills

- Multi-cloud architecture design
- Kubernetes, Helm, Argo CD
- Terraform and Terragrunt; modular, testable IaC
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions; artifact/versioning strategies and release automation
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, alerting, SLO/SLA thinking
- End-to-end security solutions with DevSecOps practices

## Experience highlights

- Built and maintained production Kubernetes clusters with autoscaling, network policies, and multi‑environment promotion
- Migrated manual deployments to GitOps, reducing change failure rate and lead time for changes
- Reduced AWS costs by improving capacity planning
- Enhanced cloud security using tools like Prisma Cloud

## Selected writing

- Kubernetes deployment guide: [/posts/k8s-deployment-guide/](/posts/k8s-deployment-guide/)
- EKS cost optimization (Part 1): [/posts/eks-cost-optimization-1/](/posts/eks-cost-optimization-1/)
- EKS cost optimization (Part 2): [/posts/eks-cost-optimization-2/](/posts/eks-cost-optimization-2/)
- Cloud Resume Challenge write‑up: [/posts/cloud-resume-challenge/](/posts/cloud-resume-challenge/)

## How I work

- Measure, then automate: instrument first, then remove toil with pipelines and platform tooling
- Security and reliability by default: least privilege IAM, policy as code, repeatable releases
- Clear documentation and standards so teams can move fast without surprises
